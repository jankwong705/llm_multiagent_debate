After fleeing to Canada during the Iranian Revolution, he pursued further education and started his academic career at the University of Toronto.\n\nLong's professional journey began when he joined Microsoft Research, where he developed the first commercial speech recognition system for Windows, which was recognized as one of the top ten technological breakthroughs of 1990. He then founded the company SpeechWorks International (now Nuance Communications), which became the world's most popular voice recognition software.\n\nIn addition to his work at SpeechWorks, Long co-founded Google Inc., where he contributed significantly to the early product developments. His contributions include leading the development of TensorFlow, a powerful open-source platform for machine learning and deep neural networks.\n\nThroughout his career, Long has made significant impacts across various fields. In academia, he served on the board of directors of Microsoft Corporation and has been named one of the \"50 Most Influential People\" in technology by Technology Review Magazine multiple times. Additionally, he has received numerous awards, including the ACM Turing Award (often referred to as the Nobel Prize of computing), recognizing his pioneering work in distributed systems and cloud computing.

He showed a keen interest in computers since childhood.\n\n- **Engineering Career**: Worked as an engineer at IBM during the early 1990s, contributing to the company's development efforts.\n\n- **First Contribution**: In the late 1990s, while still employed at IBM, Rasmus began working on a project called WebCrawler, which aimed to crawl and index the World Wide Web. Although it was not completed, this effort laid the groundwork for future developments.\n\n- **PHP Language Creation**: On September 23, 1994, Rasmus released PHP (PHP: Personal Home Page) under the GNU General Public License (GPL), marking the birth of what would become one of the most influential programming languages on the internet. PHP was designed to be simple yet powerful, making it ideal for dynamic web pages and scripts.\n\n- **Open Source Contributions**: Since its inception, PHP has been embraced by millions of developers worldwide due to its ease of use, flexibility, and extensive library support. Rasmus has been actively involved in promoting PHP and fostering a vibrant community around it. He founded the PHP.net website in 1995, which became a central hub for PHP documentation, resources, and community discussions.\n\n- **MySQL Development**: Alongside PHP, Rasmus also contributed to the development of MySQL, a relational database management system. The initial release of MySQL in 1995 marked a significant milestone in the field of databases, offering a robust solution for storing and managing data across the internet.\n\n- **Apache Support**: Recognizing the importance of server-side scripting in web development, Rasmus worked extensively with the Apache HTTP Server team. He played a crucial role in enhancing PHP\u2019s performance and ensuring better integration between PHP and Apache, leading to the creation of the mod_php module. This combination has made PHP highly compatible with Apache, providing a seamless experience for web developers.\n\n- **Linux Foundation Role**: In 2003, Rasmus co-founded the Linux Foundation, an organization dedicated to advancing open-source technologies. As a founding member, he helped establish standards and guidelines for open-source software, contributing to the growth and stability of the Linux ecosystem.\n\n- **Contributions Beyond PHP**: Throughout his career, Rasmus has continued to innovate and make significant contributions to the world of web development and open-source technology. He has authored books on PHP, contributed to the design of the Apache HTTP Server, and has been a vocal advocate for the adoption of open-source software.\n\n- **Philanthropic Efforts**: Rasmus has been recognized for his philanthropic efforts, having received several awards for his contributions to open-source software and technology. These include the PHP Programmer of the Year award in 2007, among others.\n\n- **Current Interests**: After stepping down from his roles at PHP Inc., Rasmus remains deeply engaged with the PHP ecosystem. He provides consultancy services and occasionally writes articles, continuing to share his expertise and insights with the global developer community.\n\n- **Legacy**: Rasmus Lerdorf is widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the realm of web development and open-source technology. His work on PHP, MySQL, and Apache have had a profound impact on how the web is built and managed, shaping modern web development paradigms and inspiring countless developers worldwide.\n\n---\n\nThis biography encapsulates Rasmus Lerdorf's diverse career, emphasizing his pivotal role in the development of PHP, MySQL, and Apache, along with his ongoing contributions to the open-source community."}]], "Ian Goldberg": [[{"role": "user", "content": "Give a bullet point biography of Ian Goldberg highlighting their contributions and achievements as a computer scientist, with each fact separated with a new line character.

Here is an updated and comprehensive biography of Salvatore Stolfo:\n\n---\n\nSalvatore Stolfo was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1954. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1976. His graduate studies were completed at Stanford University, where he received his Master of Science degree in Electrical Engineering in 1982 and his Doctor of Philosophy in Computer Science in 1983 under the guidance of Donald Knuth.\n\nAfter graduating, Stolfo joined AT&T Bell Laboratories as a Software Engineer in 1986. During his tenure there, he led the development of the first intrusion detection system (IDS). This pioneering work laid the foundation for modern intrusion detection technology.\n\nStolfo has made significant contributions to the fields of computer science and information security. He co-founded the Distributed Systems Research Group at AT&T Bell Labs in 1989, and later established the Center for Information Technology Security (CITS) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1990. These institutions have been pivotal in advancing research and education in information security.\n\nThroughout his career, Stolfo has authored over 20 books on information security. His works include seminal texts like \"Computer Security Handbook,\" \"Practical Intrusion Detection Systems,\" and \"Information Assurance: Principles and Practices.\" Additionally, he has contributed significantly to the development of standard evaluation criteria for intrusion detection systems (IDSEC).\n\nStolfo's expertise extended beyond academia into practical applications. In 1991, he developed the first automated intrusion detection engine capable of detecting attacks on networked computers. This groundbreaking tool marked the beginning of modern intrusion detection systems and remains influential today.\n\nStolfo\u2019s impact extends globally. He founded the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) in 1998 and served as its founding president. The IACR is dedicated to promoting research in cryptology and information security.\n\nAnother notable achievement was the establishment of the International Conference on Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications (IC3) in 2000. IC3 continues to be a leading platform for discussing and disseminating cutting-edge research in these areas.\n\nStolfo's leadership roles in both academic and industrial settings have been extensive. He served as Dean of the School of Computing and Information Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute from 2000 to 2004, and in 2010, he became the inaugural director of the Digital Forensics Research Lab at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nStolfo's professional activities also include serving on various advisory boards and committees. He has held positions such as a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) since 2006, and in 2013, he was named one of Time Magazine's \"100 Most Influential People in the World.\"\n\nNotable recognitions include being awarded the IEEE Computer Society Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015, and receiving the Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE) in 2017.
